#Once upon a time warp in deep space, the struggle between the nice & the rotten goes on...
Or to be more precise, the struggle between Those Who Want To Get Things Done & Those Who Want To Know How Long It Took Them... 

## Premise
After several impactful changes in my live, I realized I didn't have one cetralized place to keep track of all the thing I needed or wanted to do. Thinking my problem would be a common one I tried finding a tool that would allow me to do this, but after a couple of weeks of searching I still haden't found one that met my demands of having support for unlimited sub-tasks, private/public tasks and the ability to attach one note to several tasks (or vice-versa).
Most notably the combination of unlimited sub-task, a clear web interface and open-source code was something I could not find.
So I ended up writing on myself.

## Intended Use
This tool is meant as a web-based interface to let you keep track of all the things you either want or need to do across all your live's projects, with as little hassle as possible. It is currently still very much in development and should not be considered stable or usable for anything other than a nerds personal interest.
